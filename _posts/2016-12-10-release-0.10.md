0.10 is another incremental release, tidying up a few things and
adding a few minor new features.

* [on Github](https://github.com/tessera-metrics/tessera/releases/tag/v0.10)
* [on Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tessera/0.10)

## Dashboard Enhancements

### Scatter Plots

A scatter plot dashboard item has been added to plot arbitrary
correlations between data series on the X and Y axis.

### Render as Points

Time series can now be rendered as points, lines, or both.

## Other New Features

* A new `query` template tag allows queries to be re-used in other
  queries. To embed one query in another, use `{{query
  "queryname"}}`. Note that if you re-name a query, any references to
  it in other queries will need to be manually updated.
* Convenience actions have been added to the actions bar for `section`
  allowing the creation of a row containing cells in a variety of
  commonly used configurations. For example, you can now create a row
  with 4 cells of 3 column width each with a single action.

### Bug Fixes and Other Enhancements

* Performance improvements when editing queries. They no longer cause unnecessary chains of completely re-rendering the dashboard
* Fixed an ugly rendering error in percent-stacked charts
